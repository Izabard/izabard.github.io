			<p class="description">	Hello! I'm a 24 years old developer from Nicaragua that likes web development & movies. I code with PHP & Laravel Framework,
			building apps that integrates javascript and APIs. I think myself as someone that always tries the best to do the job (performance and good Ux ftw) also, I like to read about new stuff and how the world works.</p>
